# BugFace - A Program for Controlling a M5StickC BugC Robot Hat with an M5Stack FACES JoyStick

This program goes with projects [BugC](https://github.com/vkichline/BugC) and [BugController](https://github.com/vkichline/BugController).  
BugFace replaces BugController with an M5Stack FACES unit with a [Joystick Panel](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-module/products/joystick-module).

**However**, you must run the program [JoyFace](https://github.com/vkichline/JoyFace) on your M5Stack FACES Unit first to calibrate and scale the joystick.  
This sounds too complicated to tempt many casual visitors, so I'll skip detailed instructions unless there's outside interest.
